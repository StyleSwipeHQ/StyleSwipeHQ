# About Me ðŸŒŸ
Hello! I'm the person behind **Style Swipe**. Mixing my love for fashion with a knack for tech, I'm venturing into mobile app development. It's a new path for me, but I'm ready for the challenge. 

## My Interests ðŸ‘—
I'm all about merging fashion with tech. There's something thrilling about using modern technology to shake up the way we look at fashion. My dream? To build something that changes the game in how we choose and interact with our style.

## Current Learning Focus ðŸ“š
Right now, I'm deep into learning mobile app development. I'm getting my hands dirty with **React**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js**, working towards creating **Style Swipe**. This isn't just a fashion app; it's an AI-powered fashion advisor, especially for Gen Z and Millennials. Think of it as your personal stylist, but smarter and focused on sustainable fashion.

## Collaboration Opportunities ðŸ‘¥
I'm always up for working with people who get excited about tech and fashion. If you're into AI, care about sustainable fashion, or love building cool apps, let's chat. ðŸ’¬ I believe we can make something awesome together.
